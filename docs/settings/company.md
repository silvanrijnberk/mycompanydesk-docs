# Company Settings

Everything that defines how your business looks to the outside world — the name on your invoices, your logo, your public business page, and the domain customers find you on.

## Where to find it

Open the workspace switcher → **Workspace settings** → **Company**, or navigate directly to `/workspace/organization/company`.

The umbrella page is a tile menu with four leaves and a shortcut to the magical setup wizard at `/setup` (shown as a wide tile while there are still pending setup steps).

## What you can change

The Company surface is split into four focused pages.

### About your business

Path: `/workspace/organization/company/about`

The identity form. What every invoice, quote, and email shows.

- **Business name** — appears on every document
- **Address** — street, postal code, city, country (with address autocomplete)
- **Registration** — KvK or other registration number
- **Tax ID** — VAT number (e.g. `NL123456789B01`)
- **Contact** — public email, phone, support email
- **Website + social** — used by the email signature, business page, and footers

This page wraps the `CompanyInfo` component. Changes auto-save through the `useWorkspaceSettings` pipeline.

### Look & feel

Path: `/workspace/organization/company/look`

Branding for invoices, quotes, and outgoing email.

- **Logo upload** — used on every PDF and email header
- **Brand colour** — primary accent across documents and the public business page
- **PDF style presets** — gated by the `style_presets` feature (Pro and Business)
- **Document styling** — header layout, footer content, accent placement

The page is scaffolding around the existing `CompanyBranding` component (a full inner-form rebuild is on the roadmap; the chrome is already the redesigned tone).

### Your website

Path: `/workspace/organization/company/website`

A simple public business page customers can find online — contact info, what you do, and links to message you.

- Gated by the `public_business_page` feature (Pro and Business)
- Locked workspaces still see the tile but the leaf shows an upgrade prompt
- Wraps the `CompanyServices` component

When a user clicks through the wizard's "set up your website" tile they land here.

### Your own .com address

Path: `/workspace/organization/company/address`

Hook up a domain you already own (or buy a new one) for your website and email.

- Gated by the `custom_domains` feature (Pro and Business)
- Replaces the default `acme.mycompanydesk.com` subdomain
- DNS, SPF, and DKIM records are managed for you
- The DNS record table sits behind an "Advanced" strip — most users never need to look at it

This page is the most technical surface in the Company tree; the intro deliberately explains in plain language what the feature is for before any DNS UI appears.

## Plan gating quick reference

| Leaf | Free | Starter | Pro | Business |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| About your business | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Look & feel | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Your website | locked | locked | yes | yes |
| Your own .com address | locked | locked | yes | yes |

Locked tiles stay visible so you know the feature exists; clicking one opens the upgrade prompt.
